* Support for [Pygmentize]

To install, type [sudo easy_install .] in the [pygments] folder.

To use with LaTeX, add the following lines to your LaTeX file (make sure that you compile with the [-shell-escape] option):
[[
\usepackage{minted}
\usepackage{tcolorbox}

\tcbuselibrary{minted}

\makeatletter
\minted@define@switch{kwrename}{-F kwrenamefilter}
\makeatother

\newtcblisting{kcode}[1][]{
    listing engine=minted,
    minted language=extk,
    minted options={kwrename,#1}
}
]]
It is then possible to write:
[[
\begin{kcode}
    // Your K code here.
\end{kcode}
]]

Note that this lexer is far from being complete.
