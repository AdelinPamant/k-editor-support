K syntax highlighter for Notepad++

To install, open notepad++. Go to: Language (menu) -> Define your language (menu item) -> Import (button).
Choose the xml file provided (k_syntax_highlight_nppp.xml). Now close the "User Defined Language" dialog.
Now if you open any .k file, the newly imported syntax highlighting will be applied on it.
If you have a k file already open in notepad++ while you were doing the import, 
then the highlighting won't be appplied on it until you either close and reopen it,
or go to the language menu and choose K from the list.
